Reactor is a fully non-blocking reactive programming foundation for the JVM, 
with efficient demand management (in the form of managing "backpressure"). 
It integrates directly with the Java 8 functional APIs, 
notably CompletableFuture, Stream, and Duration. 
It offers composable asynchronous sequence APIs Flux (for [N] elements) 
and Mono (for [0|1] elements), extensively implementing the Reactive Extensions specification.
